The profiling module provides up to 8 64-bit profiling counters. Each counter
has a count mask with following count enables:
bit  0 => Count instruction fetches
bit  1 => Count I$ misses
bit  2 => Count I$ miss penalty
bit  3 => Count I$ flush penalty
bit  4 => Count I$ nop insertion
bit  5 => I$ reserved
bit  6 => I$ reserved
bit  7 => I$ reserved
bit  8 => pipeline reserved
bit  9 => branch penalty
bit 10 => executed instructions counting 
bit 11 => pipeline stall cycles counting
bit 12 => bus idle cycle counting
bit 13 => pipeline reserved
bit 14 => pipeline reserved
bit 15 => pipeline reserved
bit 16 => Count D$ uncacheable write accesses
bit 17 => Count D$ uncacheable read accesses
bit 18 => Count D$ cacheable write accesses
bit 19 => Count D$ cacheable read accesses
bit 20 => Count nr. of swap instruction
bit 21 => Count nr. of compare and swap instructions
bit 22 => Count nr. of D$ misses
bit 23 => Count nr. of D$ write-backs
bit 24 => Count nr. of data dependency stall cycles
bit 25 => Count nr. of write dependency stall cycles
bit 26 => Count nr. of D$ invoked pipeline stall cycles
bit 27 => Count nr. of D$ internal stall cycles
bit 28 => Count nr. of D$ write-througs
bit 29 => Count nr. of D$ snoopy invalidations
bit 30 => D$ reserved
bit 31 => D$ reserved
Note that if for example bit 16 and 17 are both set, the profiling counter 
will count all uncacheable D$ accesses. Setting the reserved bits will do
nothing.

Each of the profiling counters has a buffer of 512 32-bit counter values. How and
when an entry is written into the buffer is explained below.

The profiling module has a generic control word, defined as:
bit      0 => Profiling counter 0 present (Read only)
bit      1 => Profiling counter 1 present (Read only)
bit      2 => Profiling counter 2 present (Read only)
bit      3 => Profiling counter 3 present (Read only)
bit      4 => Profiling counter 4 present (Read only)
bit      5 => Profiling counter 5 present (Read only)
bit      6 => Profiling counter 6 present (Read only)
bit      7 => Profiling counter 7 present (Read only)
bit      8 => Profiling unit present (Read only)
bit      9 => Profiling Enable(1)/Disabled(0) (Read/Write)
bit     10 => Profiling Paused(1)/Running(0) (Read/Write)
bit 15..11 => Zero
bit     16 => Profile request (User definable)
bit 31..17 => Zero

NOTE: The count masks can only be written in 
case the profiling is disabled (bit 9 of the control word = 0).

IMPORTANT: Due to the pipe-lined nature of the profiling module, wait at least
six cycles after stopping the profile module, before reading out the profiling counter!
