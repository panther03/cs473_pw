CHANGES TO THE DCCR AND ICCR:
Bit:
  1..0 -> Number of cache ways. Valid values are 0,1 and 2 for:
          0     -> direct mapped
          1     -> 2-ways
          2     -> 4-ways
         These bits can only be written in case that the cache is disabled!
 14..2 -> Read only bits as mentioned in the specs
17..16 -> Replacement policy bits. Valid values are 0,1 and 2 for:
          0     -> FIFO
          1     -> PLRU
          2     -> LRU
    18 -> Coherency enable bit. If set the coherency protocol is activated,
          if cleared the caches act as none-coherent caches.
    19 -> Cache is enabled (read only)
    20 -> MESI protocol (1) or MSI protocol (0) (D$ only)
    21 -> Enable(1)/Disable(0 [default]) snarfing (D$ only)
    29 -> Flush Cache when 1 (Write only)
31..30 -> Cache size. Valid values are:
          0     ->  1 kbyte cache
          1     ->  2 kbyte cache
          2     ->  4 kbyte cache
          3     ->  8 kbyte cache [default]
IMPORTANT NOTE: If bit 29 is written with a '1' all other bits are treated as
don't care, hence the DCCR and ICCR are NOT changed, only a flush is performed!
